Subject: A Machine Learning Model that Can Predict Customers Who Will Leave The Company

Adjective: Prediction of how the customer churn is influenced by the importance feature based on our dataset. Machine Learning algorithms that are going to be used in this project are the logistics Algorithm, Decision Tree Classifier.

Description of the Data: We gathered the data from Kaggle.The dataset contains It consists of 10000 observations and 12 variables. Independent variables contain information about customers Dependent variable refers to customer abandonment.

Overview of the project:

1) Python for the EDA, 
2) Machine learning.
3) For the presentation will use PowerPoint presentation to show our prediction
4) Our aim in this project was to develop a churn prediction model using machine learning algorithms.

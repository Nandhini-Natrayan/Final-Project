# Final-Project


Group Members: Nandhini Natrayan, Yaren Merve Akin

Subject: Machine Learning Model that can predict customers who will leave the company(bank)

Adjective: Prediction of how the customer churn is influenced by the importance feature based on our dataset. Machine Learning algorithms that are going to be used in this project are the logistics Algorithm, Decision Tree Classifier.

Description of the Data: We gathered the data from Kaggle.The dataset contains 10000 observations and 12 variables. Independent variables contain information about customers and the Dependent variable refers to customer abandonment.

Overview of the project:

1) Python for the EDA and model Prediction
2) For the presentation will use PowerPoint presentation to show our prediction

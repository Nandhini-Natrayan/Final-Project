Subject: Prediction of student dropout and its influential parameters

Adjective: how the student dropout is influenced by the importance feature based on our dataset. Machine Learning algorithms that are going to be used in this project are the logistics Algorithm, Decision Tree Classifier,Kneigherestneibhours.

Description of the Data: We gathered the data from Kaggle.The dataset contains 4424 observations and 35 variables. Independent variables contain information about students and the Dependent variable refers to student performance.

Overview of the project:

1) Python/SQL for the EDA and model Prediction
2) For the presentation will use PowerPoint to show our prediction
